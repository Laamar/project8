1) In her book, "How Civil Wars Start," Barbara F. Walter presents a compelling argument that the United States is dangerously close to civil war in the form of a violent insurgency. Drawing on decades of analysis of the sources of political instability and violence in other countries, Walter identifies several factors that correlate with the risk of civil war and provides evidence both foreign and domestic to support her argument. One of the key concepts that Walter introduces is anocracy, which she defines as a regime type characterized by weak institutions, low levels of legitimacy, and frequent bouts of violence. Anocracies are particularly prone to civil wars because they lack the institutional capacity to prevent or manage conflicts that arise among competing groups. The US, according to Walter, has been gradually moving towards anocracy due to increasing polarization, declining trust in democratic institutions, and rising levels of violence.
Another important factor that Walter discusses is factionalism, which refers to the fragmentation of society into competing groups based on ideology, ethnicity, religion, or other identity markers. Factionalism can create conditions for conflict when groups perceive threats from each other or when one group seeks to dominate others. Superfactions  “factions within factions” further exacerbate these tensions and make it difficult for any single group to gain traction or broker a compromise. To measure the state’s stability and potential for unrest, Walter uses Polity Index Score on a scale ranging from -10 (full autocracy) to 10 (full democracy). According to this metric, the US has experienced a steady decline since 2011 and currently sits at 6 out of 10. This puts the country in what Walter calls a “danger zone,” where there is high potential for unrest but not enough pressure for change.
Ethnic entrepreneurs play an important role in exacerbating factionalism by exploiting grievances and mobilizing their followers against perceived enemies. These individuals may have legitimate concerns about inequality or discrimination, but they often seek to advance their own interests by stoking ethnic or religious tensions. In the US, Walter points to figures like Donald Trump and Black Lives Matter activists as examples of ethnic entrepreneurs who have successfully mobilized their supporters through appeals to identity.
Walter also highlights the importance of downgrading a process in which political actors begin to question the legitimacy and authority of democratic institutions such as elections, courts, and parliaments. Downgrading can occur when groups feel that these institutions are not representing their interests or when they perceive electoral outcomes as illegitimate. This erosion of trust in democratic processes can lead to violent conflict if groups resort to extra-institutional means to assert their claims. The “sons of the soil” phenomenon further complicate matters by creating conflicts between those who see themselves as native-born citizens versus immigrants or newcomers. These conflicts may be based on ethnicity, religion, language, or other factors that mark one group as belonging more than another. Sons of the soil movements often emerge in places with high levels of inequality or resource competition, where some groups feel excluded from economic opportunities or political power. 
Finally, Walter discusses the role of social media and elections in fueling the insurgency. Social media platforms provide a fertile ground for extremist ideas to spread rapidly and organize offline actions without detection from authorities. Elections become contentious when different factions view them as zero-sum games rather than opportunities for a peaceful transition of power. The 2020 presidential election is an example where accusations of fraud and irregularities undermined trust in democratic processes.

2) The genocide in Rwanda that took place between April and July 1994 resulted in the mass slaughter of over 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu people. The international community, including the United States, France, and the United Nations (UN), failed to prevent this humanitarian crisis despite having peacekeeping forces deployed in the country. The reasons for this failure are complex but can be attributed to a combination of factors such as inadequate intelligence, lack of political will, and institutional limitations.
One significant factor that contributed to the failure of peacekeeping operations was the lack of accurate information about what was happening on the ground. According to Katz, UN peacekeepers were unable to gather reliable information because they had limited language skills and knowledge of local customs. Additionally, communication with headquarters was poor due to outdated technology and insufficient resources. This made it difficult for commanders to make informed decisions about how best to respond.
Another key obstacle to effective intervention was a lack of political will among powerful countries. Mearsheimer argues that states prioritize their own interests above all else when deciding whether or not to intervene in conflicts abroad. In Rwanda's case, major powers like France and the US did not perceive any significant strategic or economic benefits from intervening. Therefore, they chose not to act decisively even though they knew what was happening.
The UN also faced institutional limitations that hindered its ability to prevent genocide in Rwanda effectively. Powers contends that bureaucratic inefficiencies within the organization led to delays in decision-making processes and hindered action on the ground. Moreover, there were structural weaknesses in UN peacekeeping operations regarding command structures and rules of engagement. Despite these challenges, some changes occurred as a result of UN and regional peacekeepers' failure in Rwanda. Finnemore notes that there has been a shift towards more robust forms of intervention since then, such as creating new institutions like the International Criminal Court (ICC) and increasing the use of targeted sanctions. Additionally, UN peacekeeping doctrine has evolved to emphasize the importance of protecting civilians in conflict zones.
In conclusion, multiple factors contributed to the international community's failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda. Inadequate intelligence, lack of political will, and institutional limitations all hindered effective intervention. However, these failures led to significant changes in peacekeeping operations that prioritize civilian protection and more robust forms of intervention. 

3) As Luttwak argues, sometimes war is necessary to achieve peace, but it must be done with a clear understanding of the complexities involved. Peacebuilding and truth commissions are often seen as the most effective means of dealing with the aftermath of civil war and genocide. While proponents argue that they have produced positive peace, their effectiveness is still a matter of debate. This essay will define and explain peacebuilding and truth commissions before reviewing their successes and failures in Rwanda and elsewhere in Africa.
Peacebuilding refers to a range of activities designed to prevent new conflicts from arising or to address the root causes of existing conflicts. According to Moore, this can include disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration programs for former combatants; reconstruction of infrastructure; establishment of democratic institutions; and promotion of human rights. Truth commissions, on the other hand, are official bodies established to investigate past human rights abuses and provide recommendations for reconciliation. Their primary goal is to establish a shared understanding of what happened during a conflict period by bringing together victims, perpetrators, and society at large.
One notable example of peacebuilding efforts in Africa is the Arusha Accords that ended the Rwandan Civil War. The agreement included provisions for power-sharing between Hutus and Tutsis in government positions while also creating an international tribunal for prosecuting those responsible for crimes against humanity during the genocide that occurred just one year later. While these efforts were initially successful in ending the conflict, many problems persisted as political violence continued into the early 2000s.
Truth commissions were established in several African countries after periods of conflict or dictatorship. One such commission was created in Rwanda following the 1994 genocide. The Commission Nationale de Lutte contre le Génocide (CNLG) was established in 1999 to investigate human rights violations committed during the genocidal period. According to Moore, it was able to create a comprehensive report documenting atrocities committed by both Hutus and Tutsis, which provided a basis for reconciliation efforts. However, the report’s recommendations were largely ignored by the government, and many Rwandans felt that justice had not been served.
Despite these efforts, violence continued in Rwanda into the early 2000s. Gourevitch argues that the Arusha Accords failed to address underlying power imbalances between Hutus and Tutsis, while Moore notes that the CNLG was hampered by a lack of resources and political will. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), established to prosecute those responsible for genocide, also faced criticism for being too slow and selective in its prosecutions. In conclusion, peacebuilding and truth commissions have had mixed success in Africa. While they have created opportunities for dialogue and reconciliation, their effectiveness has been limited by political factors such as a lack of resources and political will. Despite their shortcomings, they remain important tools for addressing past human rights abuses and preventing new conflicts from arising. As Moore notes, “peacebuilding is an ongoing process” that requires sustained effort over time. Only through continued engagement can we hope to build lasting peace in post-conflict societies.
Joseph Goebbels was a propagandist for the Nazi Party and the Reich Minister of Propaganda who took his life in 1945. During his time he wrote a novel called “Michael Ein deutsches Schicksal in Tagebuchblättern '' back in 1929 and had a political position under Hitler. Goebbels believed that making films about the Nazis era, people could see and learn from the mistakes so thier country won’t go down that road again. He felt like film makers should have made films about the drama and suffering in which the faced between WW1 and WW2. Goebbels just doesn’t find the films interesting and he called them “mained shallow and wishy washy”. I just feel like Goebbels was trying to give Germany a new look because in the previous films it made German people look weak/poor. While the Nazi Party was in charged they had a new flag and wanted a new idenity and he felt like it could be achieved through film production. With the Konigsberg musical we watched was the aftermath of WW2 when Germany was defeated with some kind of slow music to bring out the emotion of the video. With this form of film it is kind of what Goebbels was talking about, because he said that film producers will have to get used to the new standards. He wanted out with the old and in with the new, with defeat of the Nazi those type of films like the Konigsberg was the so called new. This film also shows the government walking hand in hand with the films, because Germany was under construction with rebuilding their country and how the people see the Germans. 
Once upon time there was a group of 3 friends. Tony, Romeo, and AJ who love to hike mountains with each other. AJ is the oldest out of three of them, so most of the time AJ is the one who plans most of the hiking trips and which mountain they are going to hike. Romeo is more athletic and has more durability than others due to his family living in the mountains his whole life. And there is Tony, who is more of the laid back kind of person but he is an incredible map reader because of that he has never been lost before. One day at Tony’s house he invited AJ and Romeo over just to have a few drinks and watch the football game together. As Romeo and AJ arrive at Tony’s house they get together and start drinking during the pregame show for the Denver Broncos vs the Seattle Seahawks. “What y’all want to eat during the game?” Tony asked. “Shit I can for some wings right now.” said Romeo. “Wings sound like a good idea” replied AJ and Tony. So Tony calls WingStop to order the wings. “Do y’all just want buffalo wings?” asked Tony. “Yea!” They both replied. So he goes on and orders 60 buffalo wings and two large sides of fries. As they were watching the game and eating at the same time, they all were talking and enjoying the game that was on. During a commercial break, AJ asked “Where do y’all want to go next on our next hiking trip?”. Romeo and Tony both shrugged their shoulders because they both knew if they suggested a place that AJ would definitely just pick another place or just trashed their idea. So they both said “I don’t know let’s just enjoy this game right now we can talk about that later.” As the game goes into half time, the NFL Network shows clips of interviews of different players on each team asking them what they liked about their trips to Munich Germany. Since they have been in Europe for a week preparing for this game. Some players talked about how they just like the environment over here and the views that they saw while they were in Europe. Then Russell Wilson talked about how he enjoyed climbing up the Swiss Alps with some of his teammates on this trip. When Tony, AJ, and Romeo heard that they just knew they had to go see the Swiss Alps in Switzerland for themselves. After the game they looked at each other and at the same time they said “We have to go to Switzerland and see the Swiss Alps.” They went on and flew to Switzerland the following week. When they arrived they all bought maps of the Swiss Alps so they could find their way up to the top. As a group they collectively decided on getting some rest and starting the next day because they was dealing with some jet lag due to their long flight to Switzerland. So they got up the next morning and started their adventure. While hiking up the mountain Tony was looking at the map and said “Hey guys there is this cool fountain we should go see to take pictures at.” everyone agreed. They get to the fountain and start taking pictures for their Instagram and Facebook page. In one of Tony's pictures he sat down on the fountain and his wallet fell into the water without him noticing. After they got done taking pictures they resumed hiking back up and down the mountains. They went to a Beer garden and that is when Tony realized he lost his wallet somewhere. So Tony goes looking for his wallet, he first goes looking in his bag to make sure he didn’t just put it in there by accident. So he looked all over the place then he finally gave up and accepted that he had lost his wallet. But little did he know that the fountain that his wallet fell into was a magical fountain. After a few days went by Tony’s wallet started to get some magical powers, and it flew out of the fountain looking for its owner. The wallet would fly around the mountains of the Swiss Alps looking for Tony but he was nowhere to be found. So the wallet started to get sad because he can’t find Tony and it knows that Tony must be worried sick about losing his wallet. So the little brown wallet did the only thing he could think of, and that was to fly back home to Tony’s House and wait for him. As Tony’s wallet flew back to his house the wallet put itself into the mailbox so when Tony check the mail he will see the wallet. So When Tony arrived home he went to check his mail and surprisingly he found his wallet sitting there waiting for him. The End.
